geanypy-match-html-tags
=======================

Python Plugin for geany to highlight matching html/xml tags

This Plugin is based on codebrainz/geanypy and https://github.com/codebrainz/geany-zencoding/blob/master/zencoding/html_matcher.py

Not perfect but until this is natively supported [WHICH I HOPE SOON] in geany, its quite usable.
